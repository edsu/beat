This is a silly experiment to see what sorts of relationships
between MARC records and other web resources it might be possible
to infer from the 856 fields (subfields u and 3) in the Library
of Congress' MARC data up at the Internet Archive [1]. The 856 fields
are put into MARC record as part of LC's Bibliographic Enrichment
Advisory Team [2].
